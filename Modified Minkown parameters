This is the changes to parameters provided from Oxford Nanopore, that was used for our methods.
The changes allows Minknow sequencing to have a higher treshold for error and it may have a small detrimental effect on the quality of non-modified runs, as the parameters are no longer optimised for non-modified.



C:\Program Files\OxfordNanopore\MinKNOW\ont-python\Lib\site-packages\bream\core\bream_3\config\files\pore_models\minion_RNA_sequencing.yml

Change line 18 
from:
  minimum_delta_mean: 80.0

to:
  minimum_delta_mean: 120.0

And further changing of parameters, which should prevent erroneous flicking of reads:

The new classifications in 1.13 look like they will do a better job, but still misclassify some areas of strands where the local range goes as high as 80pA. Therefore Iâ€™d recommend changing the upper limit for local range in the 1.13 read classifications.

In MinKNOW 1.13:  C:\Program Files\OxfordNanopore\MinKNOW\ont-python\Lib\site-packages\bream\core\bream_3\config\files\read_classification\minion_RNA_sequencing.yml

Change line 12
From:
  - strand      =       (local_range,gt,25)&(local_range,lt,60)&(local_median,gt,60)&(local_median,lt,115)&(local_median_sd,gt,1)&(local_median_sd,lt,4)&(duration,gt,2)

To:
  - strand      =       (local_range,gt,25)&(local_range,lt,85)&(local_median,gt,60)&(local_median,lt,115)&(local_median_sd,gt,1)&(local_median_sd,lt,4)&(duration,gt,2)
